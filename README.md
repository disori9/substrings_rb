# substrings_rb
Odin Project Exercise: Substrings

Exercise Description:
Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

Thoughts after completing: Also feels like it could be improved upon, removing the two loops.
